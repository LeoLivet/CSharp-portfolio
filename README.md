# CSharp-portfolio
In this repository i will insert the code snippets from the coding exercises from the FreeCodeCamp and microsoft C# module. I intend to use it for my personal portfolio stuff but you might find it useful if you are having trouble with the challenges yourself.

Each challenge (or snippet) is separated by regions to hopefully let you find what you need a little quicker.

It should only be the bare C# code with none of the dotnet build. But if you're doing the FCC yourself you should already have set up an environment for yourself already.
